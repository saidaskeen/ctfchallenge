    <h2>Gingersnap!</h2>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a medium bowl, whisk together 2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour, 1 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp ground ginger, 1 tsp ground cinnamon, ¼ tsp ground cloves, and ¼ tsp salt. In a large bowl, cream ¾ cup unsalted butter with 1 cup granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in 1 large egg and ¼ cup molasses. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until combined. Roll the dough into 1-inch balls and coat each ball in sugar. Place the balls on the prepared baking sheet and flatten slightly with a fork. Bake for 8-10 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. Cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy the spicy, crisp crunch!</p>
