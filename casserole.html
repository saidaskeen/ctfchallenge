    <h2>Casserole!</h2>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a large skillet, cook 1 lb ground beef or sausage over medium heat until browned, then drain excess fat. In a separate pot, cook 1 package of frozen mixed vegetables (about 2 cups) according to package instructions. In a mixing bowl, combine the cooked meat, vegetables, 1 can (10.5 oz) cream of mushroom soup, and 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese. Add salt and pepper to taste. Transfer the mixture into a greased 9x13-inch baking dish and top with 1 ½ cups tater tots or mashed potatoes. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until bubbly and golden brown. Serve hot for a hearty, comforting meal.</p>
