    Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease an 8x8-inch baking pan or line it with parchment paper. In a medium bowl, mix ½ cup melted unsalted butter and 1 cup granulated sugar until smooth. Add 2 large eggs and 1 tsp vanilla extract, stirring until combined. Sift in ⅓ cup unsweetened cocoa powder, ½ cup all-purpose flour, ¼ tsp salt, and ¼ tsp baking powder, and gently fold the dry ingredients into the wet mixture until just combined. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and spread it evenly. Bake for 20–25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with a few moist crumbs. Let the brownies cool completely in the pan before cutting into squares. Optional add-ins include ½ cup chocolate chips, ½ cup chopped nuts, or a sprinkle of flaky sea salt before baking. Enjoy your fudgy brownies!
