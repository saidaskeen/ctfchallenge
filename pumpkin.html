    <h1>Pumkin Pie</h1>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). In a large mixing bowl, combine 1 (15 oz) can of pumpkin puree, ¾ cup granulated sugar, ½ cup packed brown sugar, 1 tsp ground cinnamon, ½ tsp ground ginger, ¼ tsp ground nutmeg, ¼ tsp ground cloves, and ½ tsp salt. Whisk in 2 large eggs until fully combined, then slowly stir in 1 (12 oz) can of evaporated milk and 1 tsp vanilla extract. Roll out your prepared pie crust and fit it into a 9-inch pie dish, then pour the pumpkin filling into the crust. Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350°F (175°C) and continue baking for 40-50 minutes, or until the filling is set and a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Let the pie cool for at least 2 hours before serving. Optionally, top with whipped cream or a sprinkle of cinnamon for extra flavor.</p>
