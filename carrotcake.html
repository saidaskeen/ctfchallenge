    Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease two 9-inch round cake pans or line them with parchment paper. In a large bowl, whisk together 2 cups all-purpose flour, 2 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp baking soda, 1 ½ tsp ground cinnamon, ¼ tsp ground nutmeg, and ½ tsp salt. In another bowl, beat 4 large eggs with 1 ½ cups granulated sugar and 1 cup vegetable oil until smooth. Stir in 2 tsp vanilla extract, then fold in 3 cups grated carrots, ½ cup chopped walnuts (optional), and ½ cup raisins (optional). Pour the batter into the prepared pans and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then remove from the pans and cool completely on a wire rack. For the frosting, beat 8 oz cream cheese with ½ cup unsalted butter, 2 cups powdered sugar, and 1 tsp vanilla extract until smooth. Frost the cooled cakes and serve.
